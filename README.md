#  Automated Deployment of Tooling Website Using Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline

This README details the automated deployment process for the Tooling Website using Jenkins, a robust and widely adopted CI/CD tool. This deployment solution builds upon the architecture outlined in Project 8, which introduced horizontal scalability with multiple web servers behind a load balancer, ensuring both reliability and performance.

## Project Objectives

- **Automate Deployment**: Eliminate manual processes to achieve consistent, repeatable, and streamlined deployments.
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Leverage Jenkins to automatically build, test, and deploy any changes committed to the GitHub repository.
- **Enhanced Agility**: Reduce release cycles, allowing for faster delivery of updates, bug fixes, and new features.

## Architecture Overview

The architecture now includes Jenkins as the central CI/CD server to manage automation processes, improving the integration and deployment of updates to the Tooling Website.

### Architecture Components:

- **GitHub Repository**: Hosts the source code and serves as the main version control platform.
- **Jenkins Server**: Acts as the CI/CD server, responsible for building, testing, and deploying code changes.
- **NFS Server**: Provides a shared network file system to store and synchronize website assets.
- **Web Servers**: Serve the Tooling Website by pulling updates from the NFS server and handling incoming requests.
- **Load Balancer**: Distributes incoming traffic evenly across multiple web servers to ensure high availability.

### Workflow:

1. **Commit Changes**: Developers commit changes to the GitHub repository.
2. **Trigger Jenkins Job**: Jenkins detects changes through webhook triggers and initiates a pre-configured job.
3. **Build and Test**: Jenkins pulls the latest code from GitHub, compiles it, runs tests, and verifies code quality.
4. **Deployment to NFS Server**: Jenkins deploys the new code to the NFS server for distribution to web servers.
5. **Automatic Update on Web Servers**: Web servers are configured to pull updates from the NFS server, ensuring they reflect the latest version of the website.

## Detailed Task Breakdown

### 1. Install and Configure Jenkins

   - Install Jenkins on a dedicated server, ensuring network connectivity to access both GitHub and the NFS server.
   - Set up Jenkins to authenticate with GitHub using a personal access token or SSH key for secure access to your repository.
   - Configure Jenkins credentials for secure access to the NFS server to facilitate deployment.

### 2. Create and Configure Jenkins Job

   - **Define a Freestyle or Pipeline Job**:
      - Configure the job to use GitHub as the source repository. Use webhooks to trigger builds automatically upon each commit.
   - **Build Stages**:
      - **Code Checkout**: Jenkins clones the latest code from the GitHub repository.
      - **Build**: Configure any required build steps, such as compiling static assets or bundling files.
      - **Testing**: Set up test suites (e.g., unit tests, integration tests) to verify code quality.
      - **Deployment to NFS**: Add a post-build step to copy the updated code to the NFS server, making it available to the web servers.

### 3. Configure Web Servers to Pull Updates

   - Ensure each web server is configured to regularly sync with the NFS server to pull the latest code updates.
   - This can be set up using a cron job, rsync, or an NFS mount to allow the web servers to mirror the NFS content automatically.

### 4. Implement Security and Access Controls

   - **Jenkins Security**: Enable user authentication on Jenkins, limit permissions, and store sensitive information like credentials securely within Jenkins.
   - **NFS Security**: Restrict access to the NFS server to authorized web servers only.
   - **GitHub Integration**: Use personal access tokens or SSH keys to securely link Jenkins with GitHub for code pull and push actions.

## Benefits of Using Jenkins for CI/CD

- **Accelerated Release Cycles**: Automated deployments allow for faster and more frequent releases, leading to a responsive development cycle.
- **Improved Code Quality**: Continuous testing within the CI/CD pipeline ensures code is verified for stability before production deployment.
- **Enhanced Efficiency**: Automating deployment and testing frees developers to focus on high-value tasks.
- **Better Team Collaboration**: Jenkins facilitates smooth communication and coordination between development and operations, reducing handoff times and friction.

## Next Steps

- **Implementation**: Follow Jenkins' documentation to complete the initial setup, and ensure webhooks and pipeline configurations are correct.
- **Testing**: Conduct thorough tests to confirm the pipeline triggers correctly, builds without errors, and deploys seamlessly to the NFS server.
- **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring for both Jenkins and the deployment environment to detect and resolve any issues quickly.
